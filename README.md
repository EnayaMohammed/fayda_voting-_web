## Project Synopsis

### Problem Statement
There is a lack of secure, transparent, and accessible digital voting solutions in Ethiopia.

### Planned Solution
We are developing a highly secure, intuitive, and accessible online voting platform that leverages Fayda ID for robust user authentication. This innovative solution ensures safe, transparent, and fair elections by safeguarding voter identity and preventing fraud. Additionally, the platform features a real-time notification system to keep voters informed about important updates, deadlines, and election results, promoting greater engagement and inclusivity throughout the entire voting process.

### Expected Outcome
A functional prototype that allows users to:
- Register with Fayda ID
- Cast their votes securely
- View real-time election results with trust and transparency
- Gain notification via email.

### Fayda's Role
Fayda is used for voter verification and digital identity management. It ensures that each vote is linked to a valid, registered user, preventing fraud and duplication.
